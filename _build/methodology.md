# Data collection

Household data can be efficiently collected using the mobile survey integrated in HEDERA collect. The survey optimizes the ESMAP Energy Survey based on the Multi-tier framework, and can be efficiently completed in less than 15 minutes. 

HEDERA offers two approaches for data collection

* **In Person** (the App is used by loan officers during household visits)

* **Combination of in person and telephon interview** (the App is used by both loan officers, for example to record GPS, and by employees interviewing the clients by telephone). This approach was used in the pilot project with
[Cooperativa Fondesurco](http://hedera.online/case_studies/fondesurco.html)


In both cases, collected client data can be integrated into exiting databases available at the institution, in order to perform analysis including demographic, social, and credit historical data
